# React Native Animation Playground  Match Cards App üöÄ
This project is a playground for experimenting with various animation techniques in React Native, specifically focusing on the performance differences between different approaches.  I'm using React Native Skia and Reanimated to create and compare these animations.  The goal is to see how different strategies impact Frames Per Second (FPS) and overall smoothness.

## Skia and Reanimated 3

## CSS Transitions (Reanimated4)

## What's Inside? ‚ú®

The app consists of two main screens:

*   **Splash Screen:** This screen features heavy animations, designed to push the limits of performance and highlight the differences between animation strategies.  Think complex transitions, layered effects, and maybe even a little bit of particle magic ‚ú®.

*   **Game Screen:** A simple card matching game where you need to match 9 cards.  This screen provides a more interactive environment to test animations in a less intensive but still engaging scenario.  Perfect for testing UI transitions and subtle animations during gameplay üÉè.

## Animation Techniques üõ†Ô∏è

This project explores and compares the following animation techniques:

*   **React Native Skia:** Utilizing Skia for high-performance, GPU-accelerated animations.  We'll be experimenting with different Skia APIs and techniques to see how they perform. üé®

*   **React Native Reanimated:** Leveraging the power of Reanimated for declarative and performant animations.  We'll be exploring different Reanimated APIs and comparing them to Skia.  üí®

*   **CSS Transitions (with Reanimated 4 Beta RC1):**  With the latest Reanimated release, I'm also exploring the use of CSS-like transitions for simpler, yet performant animations.  This will allow us to compare a more declarative approach to the more direct animation methods.  This is a new and exciting addition! ü§©

## Why This Project? ü§î

I built this project to:

*   Deepen my understanding of React Native animations.
*   Compare the performance characteristics of Skia, Reanimated, and CSS Transitions in a real-world scenario.
*   Explore best practices for creating smooth and performant animations in React Native.
*   Have a bit of fun! üéâ
